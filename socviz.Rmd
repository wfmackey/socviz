## Data Visualization Notes

This is a starter RMarkdown template to accompany *Data Visualization for Social Science*. You can use it to take notes, write your code, and produce a good-looking, reproducible document that records the work you have done. At the very top of the file is a section of *metadata*, or information about what the file is and what it does. The metadata is delimited by three dashes at the start and another three at the end. You should change the title, author, and date to the values that suit you. Keep the `output` line as it is for now, however. Each line in the metadata has a structure. First the *key* ("title", "author", etc), then a colon, and then the *value* associated with the key.  

## This is an RMarkdown File

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. A *code chunk* is a specially delimited section of the file. You can add one by moving the cursor to a blank line choosing Code > Insert Chunk from the RStudio menu. When you do, an empty chunk will appear:

```{r}

```

Code chunks are delimited by three backticks (found to the left of the 1 key on US and UK keyboards) at the start and end. The opening backticks also have a pair of braces and the letter `r`, to indicate what language the chunk is written in. You write your code inside the code chunks. Write your notes and other material around them, as here. 

## Load Libraries

To begin we must load some libraries we will be using. If we do not load them, R will not be able to find the functions contained in these libraries. The tidyverse includes ggplot and other tools. We also load the socviz and gapminder libraries.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(socviz)
library(gapminder)

#devtools::install_github("HughParsonage/grattanCharts")
library(grattanCharts)

```

Notice that here, the braces at the start of the code chunk have some additional options set in them. There is the language, `r`, as before. This is required. Then there is the word `setup`, which is a label for your code chunk. Labels are useful to briefly say what the chunk does. Label names must be unique (no two chunks in the same document can have the same label) and cannot contain spaces. Then, after the comma, an option is set: `include=FALSE`. This tells R to run this code but not to include the output in the final document. 


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r look}
gapminder
```

#Shortcut list
1. Cmd + opt + I

## Generate and look at Data

```{r}
my_numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5, 25)
mean(my_numbers)
summary(my_numbers)
table(my_numbers)
my_new_vector <- c(my_numbers, "Apple") 
my_new_vector
class(my_new_vector)
titanic
titanic$percent

```


## Get Started

```{r}

```


## Make a Plot

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y=lifeExp))
p + geom_smooth()

p + geom_smooth(method = lm) + geom_point()

p + geom_smooth(method = lm) + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_x_log10()

p + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
    geom_point() +
    scale_x_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
    
grattan_dollar(10)

```


## Plot the Right Numbers

```{r}

```


## Graph Tables, Make Labels, Add Notes

```{r}

```

## Work with Models

```{r}

```

## Draw Maps

```{r}

```


## Refine your Plots

```{r}

```
